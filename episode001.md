## Transcript

Welcome to the Ourbackyard.co.za podcast. A podcast featuring short interviews with entrepreneurs from across South Africa. In today’s first episode we speed to Emmanuel from Emmanuel’s tree felling, construction, and Paint It SA.

Welcome to the Ourbackyard podcast, our very first one. Emmanuel thank you for joining me. We have used you in past, twice now, and so we know the quality of your service and what you do but, those who don’t know who you are and the business you do and the communities you serve. Please give us an introduction to your business, what you do, and where people can get hold of you.

Hi, good day. We have two companies now, the bigger one which is Emmanuel Tree felling and construction projects which most people are familiar with. There is also the sister company called Paint It SA. We work around Pretoria and the greater Gauteng, Bronkerspruit, and Middelburg. Give us a call, and we will be available.

So you said there are two companies. The tree felling and construction. The tree felling part we understand. If you need trees trimmed or removed, you can do this, but what kind of construction projects do you do?

We mainly focus on renovations. Maintenance on carports, pallisades, on homes. We are very affordable, reliable, and fully insured.

Paint It SA, is this focused on homes or also businesses?

We paint all structures and also offer spray painting of steel structures such as gates and fences. We also have trucks for rubble removals.

We all know that building a business is not easy, if it was, everybody would be doing it. There is a reason most people prefer to get a job from an employer because there is so much risk you have to take but, there is also the possibility of so much freedom.

In a lot of countries it is hard to start a business though. I am thinking of for example Africa, and South Africa in particular. I am curious, where did you start? You now have two companies and, from having spoken to you earlier, I know you are thinking of a third business idea you want to explore. But where did this all start?

It started in my mind. I was employed but also looking for jobs here and there but, I could not find anything. I always had this passion to do something for myself. The construction industry is something that is growing every day and I wanted to be part of it, to build something. I want to be one of the well-known names like Murray Roberts and Group 5. So why did I not try. Thing is, I had no money, no bakkie, and I had no machinery.

I started in Waverly standing on the corner with a cardboard saying, "Emannuel Tree felling". People would stop and ask, "You cut trees?". I would say, "Yes!". I would then get into their car and go see what they need. If I felt that I could do the job, I would give a quote and rent a chainsaw to do the work. It was a long journey.

Over time I started to get support from the local people because they saw that I did good work. For me, the most important thing is, to be honest. If I can do the job I say so, if I cannot, I will also say so and not waste people's time or money. Clients appreciate somebody who is like an open book. Somebody who is honest.

If you think about the business journey you have had up to now, if you could change one thing, what would that be?

I would like to change our financial situation. What I mean is, we need bigger trucks and machinery so, more business support from financial institutions would be great. I would also like to have the business positioned to be able to be tender for government contracts and have a way to better represent the work we have done.

A similar question for you is, if there is one piece of advice you can give to new business owners, what would that be?

Do not get a loan to start a business. A business starts in your mind, not because you habe finance. It must be something that you dream about. That is the only way that it can work. It must be something you feel in you. You might even have sleepless nights because of it. Make it work with the money you have in your pocket.

Don’t take loans, cash or hand-outs from anybody to start your business. Don’t do that.

Thank you Emannuel, this was great. Great to have you on the first episode of our podcast. I hope you have inspired others to start their own businesses. In closing, how can people get in touch with you?
